# Welcome to the Jungsu Kim Laboratory

The research laboratory led by [Jungsu Kim, PhD](https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/41977/kim-jungsu), is interested in understanding the molecular and cellular basis of neuronal and glial dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease, other aging-associated neurodegenerative diseases, and normal brain aging.

Research in Kim lab is aimed at developing therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer’s disease by targeting microglial proteins implicated in neuroinflammation as well as brain lipid-regulating proteins, such as apolipoprotein E (ApoE), low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). Kim lab is also interested in the role of epigenetics and non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease and other aging-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Emerging transcriptomics technologies recently revealed that many non-coding regions encode functional RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).

Using genetically modified animal models, human biospecimens, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), emerging single-cell transcriptomics, single-cell proteomics, and systems biology approaches, Kim lab investigates the function of multiple microglial proteins, ApoE-binding proteins, and non-coding RNAs that may play critical roles in neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging.
